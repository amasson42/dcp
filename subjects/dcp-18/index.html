<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked
only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.</p>
<p>Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_locked</code>, which returns whether the node is locked</li>
<li><code>lock</code>, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false.
Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.</li>
<li><code>unlock</code>, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false.
Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like.
You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes.
Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.</p>
