<div><p>This problem was asked by Apple.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the <code>i</code>-th row
and <code>j</code>-th column is <code>(i + 1) * (j + 1)</code> (if 0-indexed) or <code>i * j</code> (if 1-indexed).</p>
<p>Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.</p>
<p>For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:</p>
<p>| 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |</p>
<p>| 2 | 4  | 6  | 8  | 10 | 12 |</p>
<p>| 3 | 6  | 9  | 12 | 15 | 18 |</p>
<p>| 4 | 8  | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |</p>
<p>| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |</p>
<p>| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |</p>
<p>And there are 4 12's in the table.</p>
