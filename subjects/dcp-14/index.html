<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists
are non-cyclical.</p>
<p>For example, given A = 3 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 10 and B = 99 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 10, return the node with value 8.</p>
<p>In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.</p>
<p>Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.</p>
