<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Twitter.</p>
<p>You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last <code>N</code> <code>order</code> ids in a log.
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:</p>
<ul>
<li>record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log</li>
<li>get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.</p>
