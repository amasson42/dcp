<div><p>This problem was asked by Amazon.</p>
<p>Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water,
so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.</p>
<p>For example, this matrix has 4 islands.</p>
<pre><code>1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
</code></pre></div>
