<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.</p>
<p>For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right, then down</li>
<li>Down, then right</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.</p>
