<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.</p>
<p>For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.</p>
<p>Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.</p>
