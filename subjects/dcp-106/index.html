<div><p>This problem was asked by Twitter.</p>
<p>Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
Assume that each node in the tree also has a pointer to its parent.</p>
<p>According to the definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor">LCA on Wikipedia</a>:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”</p>
