<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order,
write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying
and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.</p>
<p>For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock
at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.</p>
