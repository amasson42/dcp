<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Cisco.</p>
<p>Given an unsigned 8-bit integer, swap its even and odd bits. The 1st and 2nd bit should be swapped, the 3rd and 4th bit should be swapped, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, <code>10101010</code> should be <code>01010101</code>. <code>11100010</code> should be <code>11010001</code>.</p>
<p>Bonus: Can you do this in one line?</p>
