<div><p>This problem was asked by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers,
print out the median of the list so far on each new element.</p>
<p>Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.</p>
<p>For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:</p>
<pre><code>2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
</code></pre></div>
