<p>Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size <code>n</code>,
and contain the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set(key, value)</code>: sets <code>key</code> to <code>value</code>. If there are already <code>n</code> items in the cache and we are adding a new
item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently
used key should be removed.</li>
<li><code>get(key)</code>: gets the value at <code>key</code>. If no such key exists, return null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each operation should run in O(1) time.</p>
