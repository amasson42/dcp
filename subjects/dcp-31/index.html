<p>The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.</p>
<p>For example, given the set <code>{1, 2, 3}</code>, it should return <code>{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}</code>.</p>
<p>You may also use a list or array to represent a set.</p>
