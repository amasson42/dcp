<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Amazon.</p>
<p>An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.</p>
<p>Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element
doesn't exist in the array, return null.</p>
<p>For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).</p>
<p>You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.</p>
