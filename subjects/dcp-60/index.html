<div><p>This problem was asked by Square.</p>
<p>Assume you have access to a function <code>toss_biased()</code> which returns
0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0).
You do not know the bias of the coin.</p>
<p>Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.</p>
