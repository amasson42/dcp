<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.</p>
<p>You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard.
Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).</p>
<p>For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:</p>
<ul>
<li>(0, 0)</li>
<li>(1, 2)</li>
<li>(2, 2)</li>
<li>(4, 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The board would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]
</code></pre><p>You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.</p>
