<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Jane Street.</p>
<p>Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array.
Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence
of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up
with some amount greater than A of that currency.</p>
<p>There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.</p>
