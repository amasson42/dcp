<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Stripe.</p>
<p>Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.</p>
<p>It should contain the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>set(key, value, time)</code>: sets key to value for t = time.</li>
<li><code>get(key, time)</code>: gets the key at t = time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever
or until it gets set at a later time. In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value
that was set for that key set at the most recent time.</p>
<p>Consider the following examples:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-python">d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-python">d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2
</code></pre>
