<div><p>This problem was asked by Snapchat.</p>
<p>Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.</p>
<p>The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.</p>
<p>For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].</p>
