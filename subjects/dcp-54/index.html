<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets
whose sums are the same.</p>
<p>For example, given the multiset <code>{15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}</code>, it would return true, since we
can split it up into <code>{15, 5, 10, 15, 10}</code> and <code>{20, 35},</code> which both add up to <code>55</code>.</p>
