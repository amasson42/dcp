<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive),
where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an
array using only swaps.</p>
<p>It should run in O(N) time.</p>
<p>Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.</p>
