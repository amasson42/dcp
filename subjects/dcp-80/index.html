<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).</p>
<p>For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.</p>
