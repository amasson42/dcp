<div><p>This problem was asked by Amazon.</p>
<p>There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase.
The order of the steps matters.</p>
<p>For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 1, 1, 1</li>
<li>2, 1, 1</li>
<li>1, 2, 1</li>
<li>1, 1, 2</li>
<li>2, 2</li>
</ul>
<p>What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number
from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5
steps at a time.</p>
