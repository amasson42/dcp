<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.</p>
<p>For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.</p>
<p>You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.</p>
