<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Yelp.</p>
<p>Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent.
You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.</p>
<p>For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].</p>
