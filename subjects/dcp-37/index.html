<div><p>This problem was asked by Amazon.</p>
<p>Implement a stack that has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack</li>
<li>pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.</li>
<li>max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each method should run in constant time.</p>
