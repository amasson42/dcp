<div><p>This problem was asked by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.</p>
<p>Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.</p>
<p>For example, given the following tree:</p>
<pre><code>    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
</code></pre><p>You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).</p>
