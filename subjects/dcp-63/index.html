<div><p>This problem was asked by Facebook.</p>
<p>Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.</p>
<p>For example, if the list is <code>[-10, -10, 5, 2]</code>, we should return <code>500</code>, since that's <code>-10 * -10 * 5</code>.</p>
<p>You can assume the list has at least three integers.</p>
