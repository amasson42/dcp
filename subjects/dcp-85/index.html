<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Dropbox.</p>
<p>What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

for f in functions:
    print(f())
</code></pre>
