<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Amazon.</p>
<p>Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.</p>
<p>For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we
would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.</p>
<p>Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.</p>
<p>Do this in O(N) time.</p>
