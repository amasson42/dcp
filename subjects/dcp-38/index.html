<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of
inversions it has. Two elements <code>A[i]</code> and <code>A[j]</code> form an inversion if <code>A[i] &gt; A[j]</code> but <code>i &lt; j</code>.
That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.</p>
<p>Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.</p>
<p>You may assume each element in the array is distinct.</p>
<p>For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3).
The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.</p>
