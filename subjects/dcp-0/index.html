<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by no one.</p>
<p>Write a function that takes three parameters. The first is a string, the second is an int and the last is an array of int.</p>
<p>Return a string that is the concatenation of those three parameters.</p>
<p>For example, if we send "super", 42, [1, -5, 9] then the function will return "super421-59"</p>
