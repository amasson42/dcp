<h1>Problem</h1>
<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the k<sup>th</sup> last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list.</p>
<p>The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Do this in constant space and in one pass.</p>
