<div><p>This problem was asked by Google.</p>
<p>Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k.
If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.</p>
<p>Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.</p>
<p>For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.</p>
